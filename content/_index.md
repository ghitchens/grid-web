# Our Story

We founded GRID22 out of frustration with the current crop of collaboration and remote work products.  We believe we have better ideas, and can deliver them.

We went though a fairly deep exploratory and prototyping phase and are now actively developing our first product.  We will keep this site up to date with link to our product web site as we approach release.

Feel free to [sign up for our newsletter](#stay-in-touch) if you want us to keep you up to date on our progress.  If you are interested in contacting us, feel free to use our [contact form](#contact-us) and we will be happy to back to you with any questions.
